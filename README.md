# BARUA - Simplify Your Letter Writing

BARUA, which means "letters" in Swahili, is a web application built to streamline the letter writing process. It allows users to easily create different types of letters by selecting a template and providing the necessary details. Once the details are entered, BARUA generates a downloadable and printable version of the letter.

BARUA is built using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript, making it a modern and efficient solution for your letter-writing needs.
